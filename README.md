# Hello there

Im just another random dude on the internet which likes to use computers and play games. I dont have that much coding experience but i have made a QuestToolbox with a friend if you want to check that out [here](https://github.com/mitchv2020/QuestToolbox/releases)

For now im just working on [QuestToolbox](https://github.com/mitchv2020/QuestToolbox/releases) until i know what else to do or if i learn to code better

The coding languages i know so far:

    - Batch
    - Python (i dont know a whole lot)
    - HTML/CSS (basics)

I know batch the most but im still not that great with it. I have started learning python in school recently so hopefully i get better at that.

I am currently also working on some simple VRChat avatars with LordNikon [Here](https://www.fiverr.com/mitchv2020/make-simple-vrchat-avatars)

If you want to message me here is my Discord: [mitchv2020#5697](https://discord.com/users/330282620833366016)

thats basically all i have to say so yeah. cya!
